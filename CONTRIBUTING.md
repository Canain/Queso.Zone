## Welcomed improvements
### Security
Since the app was made to provide a proof of concept of various features, security can be greatly improved.

Possible contributions to Firebase rules and adding containerization for the server compilation are greatly welcomed

### Performance
Again, since the app was made as a proof of concept, numerous parts were written for fast development instead of performance.

Any improvement involving reducing Firebase bandwidth and render speed are welcomed.

### Tests
Currently, the app has no automated tests.

All levels of testing to be added are welcome but as of now there isn't a set system for running tests and reporting build errors.
